Jupyter Notebooks and the rich Python ecosystem with libraries on a variety of topics can engage many learners of the sciences and humanities. Interactive content, using Jupyter Widgets and visualization libraries, put the student in charge of manipulating content and extending their learning. Giving students engaging content in familiar subjects encourages them to develop and use computational skills to build upon their interests.\n",

       "One difficulty of teaching workshops is access to computers and the ability to install software on those systems. This talk will demonstrate how a workshop organizer or teacher can deploy JupyterHub easily for a class using the Zero to JupyterHub Guide, Kubernetes, and Cloud Services. Even if students only have access to smartphones, tablets, or shared computers, a workshop can be held using Binder which allows a notebook environment to be served at the click of a button to any modern web browser.\n",

This process is difficult under the best of circumstances; in our case, we are interested not in single objects but rather a collection of deformable objects. Motile cilia are microscopic, hair-like structures that protrude from cells and beat in synchrony to move particulates and irritants away and bring nutrients in. Cilia line the exterior of cells in nearly every part of the body; as such, diseases that affect cilia and their ability to beat properly can have myriad and severe consequences on the patient's health. To that end, studying the motion of cilia is important to better understand the pathologies of these diseases. In this talk, we'll discuss some of the basics of object segmentation, and how many of the basic assumptions are violated in circumstances such as identifying cilia in a video. We'll look at live demonstrations of alternative segmentation approaches that can be used on diffuse motion patterns such as those created by moving cilia, using Jupyter notebooks and ipywidgets to create a beginner-friendly walkthrough of the basics of ciliary motion analysis and segmentation methods.\n"
