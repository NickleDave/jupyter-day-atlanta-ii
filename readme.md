## About

Jupyter Day Atlanta is a single-day conference for Jupyter users in the Southeast.  The [Atlanta
Jupyter User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jupyter-User-Group/) is excited to host this event to showcase applications
of the open source software created by Project Jupyter and community. These interactive technologies
are reshaping how people interact with code and data in both industry and academia.  

Jupyter Day Atlanta is a chance for Jupyter users of all experience levels to share and learn about 
the state-of-the-art in open source scientific computing. This event is inspired by
[past and future events](docs/events.md) hosted by the Jupyter community, and hopes to connect
people across the Southeast including Atlanta, Athens, Raleigh, Columbia, Charlotte, and more.
